# tRPC Route Handlers

Use this folder to place your route specific API controller logic.
The routes defined in this folder can then be merged in the main AppRouter (_../router.ts_).
https://trpc.io/docs/server/merging-routers

All code in this folder can be moved to a separate package if you want to share it between multiple apps.

> NOTE: This doesn't use the Next.js folder style routing, it's just a place to organise logic.
